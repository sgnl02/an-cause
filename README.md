#AN

AN is going to be a Firefox OS-app to
*	Read news-alerts
*	Share news-alerts
*	E-mail people to take action

##Future goals

*	Cleanup
*	Change the "hamburger-menu" to
one that works: http://lmjabreu.com/post/why-and-how-to-avoid-hamburger-menus/
*	Or perhaps not: http://mattdsmith.com/hamburger/
*	Modularize code better
*	Hopefully fork this into a Phonegap-project

##Bugs

*	Screen flashes white on hitting back (perhaps it's just my testing-device?)
*	Pulling updates deletes email
